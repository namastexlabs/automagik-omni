# 🎯 SOLUTION: Fixed AsyncMock.keys() Error in Evolution API Tests

## 🚨 **Problem Identified**
```
Evolution API request failed: AsyncMock.keys() returned a non-iterable (type coroutine)
```

**Root Cause Location:** `/home/cezar/automagik/automagik-omni/src/channels/whatsapp/channel_handler.py:294`

```python
# Line 294: This line calls .keys() on connect_response
f"Response is dict with keys: {list(connect_response.keys())}"
```

**Exact Issue:** In test mocks, `connect_response` was an AsyncMock object, not a real dictionary. When `.keys()` was called on AsyncMock, it returned a coroutine instead of the actual keys.

## 🔧 **Solution Applied**

### **File Modified:** `/home/cezar/automagik/automagik-omni/tests/conftest.py`

**Before (Line 251):**
```python
mock_evolution.connect_instance = AsyncMock(return_value={"qr": "test-qr"})
```

**After (Lines 251-254):**
```python
# Fix connect_instance to return a proper dict that supports .keys()
async def mock_connect_instance(*args, **kwargs):
    return {"qr": "test-qr", "base64": "test-base64-qr"}
mock_evolution.connect_instance = mock_connect_instance
```

## ✅ **Why This Fix Works**

1. **AsyncMock Issue:** `AsyncMock(return_value=dict)` creates an AsyncMock object, not a real dictionary
2. **Method Call Problem:** When code calls `response.keys()`, it's calling `AsyncMock.keys()` which returns a coroutine
3. **Our Solution:** Replace with a proper async function that returns a real dictionary
4. **Result:** The returned dictionary has normal `.keys()` behavior

## 🎯 **Technical Details**

**The Error Chain:**
1. Test setup: `mock_evolution.connect_instance = AsyncMock(return_value={"qr": "test-qr"})`
2. Code execution: `connect_response = await evolution_client.connect_instance(instance.name)`
3. Result: `connect_response` is the AsyncMock object itself, not the dictionary
4. Error trigger: `list(connect_response.keys())` calls AsyncMock.keys() → coroutine
5. Crash: `list()` can't iterate over coroutine

**Our Fix:**
1. New setup: `mock_evolution.connect_instance = mock_connect_instance` (async function)
2. Code execution: `connect_response = await evolution_client.connect_instance(instance.name)`
3. Result: `connect_response` is a real dictionary `{"qr": "test-qr", "base64": "test-base64-qr"}`
4. Success: `list(connect_response.keys())` returns `["qr", "base64"]`

## 📋 **Files Involved**

- **Main Issue:** `src/channels/whatsapp/channel_handler.py:294`
- **Fixed:** `tests/conftest.py:251-254`
- **Error Context:** Evolution API QR code handling in WhatsApp channel

## 🚀 **Expected Results**

After this fix:
- ✅ Evolution API tests will pass
- ✅ QR code request handling will work correctly  
- ✅ No more "AsyncMock.keys() returned a non-iterable" errors
- ✅ The channel handler can properly inspect response dictionary structure

## 🔍 **Verification Commands**

```bash
# Test the specific functionality
python -m pytest tests/ -k "evolution" -v

# Or test all WhatsApp related tests
python -m pytest tests/ -k "whatsapp" -v

# Full test suite
python -m pytest tests/
```

## 🧞 **Summary**

The Evolution API error was caused by improper mock setup in tests. The mock returned an AsyncMock object instead of a real dictionary, causing `.keys()` calls to fail. We fixed this by replacing the AsyncMock with a proper async function that returns an actual dictionary, ensuring all dictionary methods work correctly.

**Status: ✅ RESOLVED**

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack Detection

**The automagik-omni-genie-analyzer agent will automatically detect:**
- Programming languages (Go, Rust, Java, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, etc.)
- Frameworks (React, Vue, Django, FastAPI, Spring Boot, Gin, etc.)
- Build systems (Maven, Gradle, Cargo, Go modules, npm/yarn, etc.)
- Testing frameworks (Jest, pytest, Go test, Cargo test, etc.)
- Quality tools (ESLint, Ruff, rustfmt, gofmt, etc.)

**No manual configuration needed** - the analyzer handles tech stack adaptation!

## üß† Context Engineering System (CRITICAL)

### üéØ Agent Context Rules
**ALL AGENTS MUST FOLLOW THESE RULES:**

1. **Before Starting ANY Task**:
   - Check for existing wish file: `genie/wishes/[task-name].md`
   - If no wish file exists, create one using template
   - ALWAYS reference wish file in agent prompt: `@genie/wishes/[task-name].md`

2. **During Task Execution**:
   - Read wish file completely before starting work
   - Update wish file with ALL discoveries, issues, and progress
   - Create sub-files for detailed findings: `[task-name]/[discovery].md`

3. **Task Completion**:
   - Update wish file with final results and status
   - Verify actual results match claimed results
   - Document what worked and what didn't for future agents

### üö® Context Engineering Prevents
- ‚ùå Knowledge loss between agent sessions
- ‚ùå Repeated investigation of same issues  
- ‚ùå Inconsistent progress reporting (claiming success when tests still fail)
- ‚ùå Context silos between specialized agents

## üéØ Development Workflow

### First Steps  
1. **Create/Check Wish File**: Every task needs `genie/wishes/[task-name].md`
2. **Analyze your codebase**: `/wish "analyze this codebase"`
3. **Get tech-stack-specific recommendations**: Analyzer will provide language/framework-specific guidance
4. **Start development**: Use detected patterns and tools for optimal development experience

### Available Hooks (Working Examples!)
- **TDD Guard**: Real TDD workflow enforcement with multi-language support
- **Quality Automation**: Pre-commit validation with auto-detected tech stack tools
- **Ready to Use**: Copy templates, make executable, customize for automagik-omni

## üìö Getting Started

Run your first wish to let the analyzer understand your project:
```
/wish "analyze this codebase and provide development recommendations"
```

The analyzer will auto-detect your tech stack and provide customized guidance!

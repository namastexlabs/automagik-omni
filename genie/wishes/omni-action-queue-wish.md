# ðŸ§ž Omni Action Queue WISH

**Status:** DRAFT
**Parent Wish:** @genie/wishes/omni-event-fabric-and-action-engine.md
**Dependency:** @genie/wishes/omni-event-fabric-foundation-wish.md (must complete first)

## Executive Summary
Build a robust asynchronous action processing system for Omni events, enabling reliable webhook handling, retry logic, and scalable action execution without blocking the ingestion pipeline.

## Current State Analysis
- **What exists:** Synchronous processing in channel handlers; no retry mechanism; failures block ingestion
- **Gap identified:** No queue infrastructure, no worker processes, no dead letter handling
- **Solution approach:** Introduce lightweight queue (Redis/BullMQ or SQLite-based), worker pool, retry logic, monitoring

## Success Criteria
âœ… Incoming events queued for async processing without blocking webhook responses
âœ… Worker processes execute actions with configurable concurrency
âœ… Failed actions retry with exponential backoff
âœ… Dead letter queue captures persistently failing events
âœ… Queue metrics exposed for monitoring (depth, throughput, failure rate)

## Technical Architecture
Events flow: webhook â†’ omni_events (sync) â†’ queue â†’ workers â†’ action execution
Queue options evaluation:
- **Option A: Redis + BullMQ** - Battle-tested, UI dashboard, complex setup
- **Option B: SQLite + Celery** - Simple deployment, uses existing DB, less scalable
- **Option C: PostgreSQL LISTEN/NOTIFY** - Native if we migrate from SQLite
- **Decision Required:** Balance simplicity vs scalability for local-first deployment

## Task Decomposition
- **Group Name:** queue-infrastructure
  - **Goal:** Set up chosen queue system with workers
  - **Creates/Modifies:** Queue tables/Redis setup, worker processes, configuration
  - **Dependencies:** Foundation wish complete, queue technology chosen

- **Group Name:** action-registry
  - **Goal:** Define action types, handlers, and routing
  - **Creates/Modifies:** Action handler classes, registry pattern, configuration schema
  - **Dependencies:** Queue infrastructure ready

- **Group Name:** retry-resilience
  - **Goal:** Implement retry logic, dead letter queue, monitoring
  - **Creates/Modifies:** Retry policies, DLQ handling, metrics endpoints
  - **Dependencies:** Action registry complete

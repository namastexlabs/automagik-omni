# üßû Discord WhatsApp Parity WISH

**Status:** DRAFT

## Executive Summary
Elevate the Discord integration to persist users, traces, and payloads with the same contracts WhatsApp relies on so a single human identity flows cleanly across channels.

## Current State Analysis
**What exists:** Discord handlers route inbound messages and send responses without writing `message_traces`, `trace_payloads`, or shared user links; WhatsApp paths already provide full persistence, router context, and telemetry.
**Gap identified:** Discord lacks parity for user creation/lookup, trace persistence, normalized payload storage, session naming, and identity linkage, producing fragmented observability and duplicate humans.
**Solution approach:** Apply WhatsApp parity patterns to Discord by introducing trace writers, payload persistence, identity linking helpers, and documentation updates while preserving existing routing surfaces.

## Change Isolation Strategy
- **Isolation principle:** Localize persistence changes within Discord channel modules, shared services, and new identity helpers without touching unrelated channels.
- **Extension pattern:** Reuse WhatsApp abstractions where possible; add Discord-specific adapters rather than rewriting shared router or DB layers.
- **Stability assurance:** Gate new behavior behind channel-type checks and maintain existing WhatsApp flows by mirroring, not altering, their contracts.

## Success Criteria
‚úÖ Inbound and outbound Discord traffic writes `message_traces` rows with `channel_type="discord"` and linked `trace_payloads` entries.
‚úÖ Discord inbound path resolves or creates users following the same identity rules as WhatsApp, including cross-channel linking.
‚úÖ MessageRouter receives consistent session metadata (name, origin, trace context) for Discord and WhatsApp with validated logs.
‚úÖ Documentation explains Discord parity flow, linking behavior, and operational verification steps.

## Never Do (Protection Boundaries)
‚ùå Modify WhatsApp tracing logic except for shared helper extraction that keeps semantics identical.
‚ùå Introduce direct database writes outside existing ORM/service patterns.
‚ùå Ship without Red‚ÜíGreen‚ÜíRefactor validation proving trace persistence and identity linking.

## Technical Architecture

### Component Structure
- `src/channels/discord/channel_handler.py`: Inbound Discord event handling, media normalization, router invocation.
- `src/channels/message_sender.py` & `src/channels/discord/bot_manager.py`: Outbound dispatch with access to Discord connector.
- `src/services/message_router.py`: Shared routing service; ensures Discord parity for session metadata and trace context.
- `src/services/trace_service.py` (or equivalent WhatsApp helper): Reference patterns for writing `message_traces` and `trace_payloads`.
- `src/services/user_service.py` & related models: Existing user persistence to mirror for Discord identities.
- `migrations/` + potential `user_external_ids` model: Storage for cross-channel links.

### Data Flow Overview
1. **Inbound Discord event** ‚Üí channel handler ‚Üí user lookup/linker ‚Üí trace writer ‚Üí router.
2. **Router response** ‚Üí outbound sender ‚Üí Discord API ‚Üí trace writer with payload/result.
3. **Identity linking** ensures `(provider, external_id)` mapping unifies Discord and WhatsApp humans.
4. **Telemetry/logging** emits trace identifiers for observability dashboards.

### Contracts & Interfaces
- Maintain MessageRouter contract: `route_message(user, session_name, session_origin, trace_context, media, text)`.
- Trace records mirror WhatsApp schema: direction, message_id, has_media, has_quoted_message, payload reference.
- Identity linker exposes `resolve_user(provider, external_id)` and `upsert_link(user_id, provider, external_id, extra)` semantics.

## Development Phases
- **Phase 1 ‚Äî Discovery & Pattern Mapping:** Audit WhatsApp tracing, payload, and user flows; catalog Discord touchpoints needing parity.
- **Phase 2 ‚Äî Inbound Trace Persistence:** Implement Discord inbound trace + payload writes with raw event capture and normalized metadata.
- **Phase 3 ‚Äî Outbound Trace Persistence:** Add outbound trace/payload records covering success and error cases with Discord-specific payload shapes.
- **Phase 4 ‚Äî User & Session Parity:** Mirror WhatsApp user lookup/creation, align session naming/origin, and integrate trace context through MessageRouter.
- **Phase 5 ‚Äî Identity Linking:** Introduce or extend `user_external_ids` model, helpers, and Discord usage; ensure WhatsApp path consumes the shared helper.
- **Phase 6 ‚Äî Validation & Documentation:** Execute automated tests, manual message flows, and update parity docs plus operational runbook.

## Validation Plan
- `uv run pytest tests/channels/discord/test_channel_handler.py` (extend or create) covering inbound trace + user behaviors.
- `uv run pytest tests/channels/test_message_sender.py::TestDiscordSender` verifying outbound trace records and failure handling.
- `uv run pytest tests/services/test_identity_linking.py` validating linker helpers and cross-channel resolution.
- Manual guild mention + DM against staging bot, confirm `message_traces` and `trace_payloads` rows plus logs show shared user_id.
- Optional script: `uv run python scripts/show_recent_traces.py --channel discord --limit 5` to demonstrate parity.

## Evidence Requirements
- Test outputs demonstrating new/updated pytest cases pass.
- Database snapshots or ORM query logs proving `message_traces` and `trace_payloads` rows for Discord events.
- Application logs highlighting aligned trace metadata (trace_id, user_id, session_origin="discord").
- Documentation diff referencing parity guidance and runbook steps.

## Task Decomposition
- **Group A ‚Äî Parity Research:** WhatsApp reference mapping, Discord touchpoint inventory, alignment notes.
- **Group B ‚Äî Inbound Persistence:** Implement inbound trace writer, payload storage, and logging updates.
- **Group C ‚Äî Outbound Persistence:** Persist outbound traces/payloads, handle retries, and error logging.
- **Group D ‚Äî Identity Linking:** Introduce/link `user_external_ids`, update Discord/WhatsApp lookups, add helpers + tests.
- **Group E ‚Äî Docs & Tooling:** Update README/channel docs, add trace inspection script, capture validation evidence.

## Open Questions & Assumptions
- **Assumption:** WhatsApp parity patterns remain source of truth; no breaking changes pending.
- **Assumption:** Database schema can accept `user_external_ids` addition without conflicting migrations.
- **Question:** Do we require media payload storage for Discord attachments beyond metadata (size, URL)?
- **Question:** Should identity linking expose admin tooling or remain API-only for this wish?

## Dependencies & Partners
- Coordinate with data/infra owners for migration review (`user_external_ids`).
- Confirm with observability owners that new Discord trace fields integrate with dashboards.
- Notify QA to design multi-channel regression scenarios once implementation begins.

## Documentation Targets
- Update channel parity section in `docs/integrations/discord.md` (or equivalent) with trace + linking behavior.
- Extend runbook with verification steps for tracing, payload inspection, and identity linkage troubleshooting.
- Append wish status and evidence summary to `genie/wishes/discord-whatsapp-parity.md` during execution oversight.

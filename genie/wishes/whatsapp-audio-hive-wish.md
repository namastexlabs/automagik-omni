# üßû WhatsApp Audio Hive WISH

**Status:** APPROVED

## Executive Summary
Enable WhatsApp audio messages to be processed end-to-end through Hive for ASR, answer generation, and TTS, then return synthesized audio back to WhatsApp.

## Current State Analysis
**What exists:** WhatsApp handlers manage text workflows; Hive integrations exist for text-based agent runs; no audio extraction/upload pipeline.  
**Gap identified:** Audio messages are not transformed into Hive-compatible files, nor are Hive audio artifacts routed back to WhatsApp.  
**Solution approach:** Build an always-on audio bridge that extracts WhatsApp audio, posts it to Hive as a multipart run, retrieves Hive responses (audio bytes, audio URLs, or plain text), and forwards them through existing Evolution senders with robust validation and docs.

## Fork Compatibility Strategy
- **Isolation principle:** Keep changes scoped to WhatsApp audio handling and the Hive client so default text flows remain untouched.  
- **Extension pattern:** Reuse existing WhatsApp handler hooks and Hive client abstractions without modifying unrelated channel logic.  
- **Merge safety:** Contain edits to WhatsApp audio handling, Hive client helpers, and docs/tests so upstream merges remain conflict-light.

## Success Criteria
‚úÖ WhatsApp audio converted to temp WAV/OGG files with correct MIME detection.  
‚úÖ Hive `/playground/agents/{agent_id}/runs` invoked via multipart upload and returns audio artifact reference.  
‚úÖ WhatsApp handler relays Hive-produced responses (audio bytes, audio URLs, or plain text) directly through Evolution senders.  
‚úÖ Automated tests cover audio extraction lifecycle and mocked Hive round-trip; documentation explains response handling behaviors.

## Never Do (Protection Boundaries)
‚ùå Modify text-only WhatsApp routing paths or enable streaming in Omni.  
‚ùå Introduce unchecked audio streaming outside Hive's standard response handling.  
‚ùå Diverge from the principle that Omni forwards Hive responses exactly as returned (text stays text, audio stays audio).

## Technical Architecture

### Component Structure
Backend (Python):
- `src/channels/whatsapp/handlers.py` ‚Äì invoke audio pipeline for incoming audio and forward Hive responses.
- `src/services/hive_client.py` (or equivalent) ‚Äì add multipart audio run helper.
- `src/services/audio_processing/` (new or existing) ‚Äì manage base64 decoding, MIME inference, temp file lifecycle.
- `src/channels/evolution_api_sender.py` ‚Äì ensure audio send helper handles Hive response payloads (bytes or URLs) and plain text passthrough.

Support:
- `tests/channels/whatsapp/test_audio_to_hive.py` ‚Äì unit/integration coverage.  
- `docs/features/whatsapp-audio-hive.md` ‚Äì configuration + ops notes.

### Naming Conventions
- Temp audio files: `wa-audio-<uuid>.{ext}` stored via `tempfile`.  
- Branches: `feat/whatsapp-audio-hive-foundation`, `feat/whatsapp-audio-hive-integration`, `test/whatsapp-audio-hive-validation`.

## Task Decomposition

### Dependency Graph
```
A[Foundation] ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ñ∫ B[Integration] ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ñ∫ C[Validation]
```

### Group A (Foundation) ‚Äì Branch `feat/whatsapp-audio-hive-foundation`
- Extract base64 audio from Evolution webhook payloads, detect MIME, and persist as temp WAV/OGG.  
- Implement Hive multipart upload (`message`, `stream=false`, `monitor=false`, `session_id`, `user_id`, audio file field).  
- Parse Hive response and expose response contract that can represent audio bytes, audio URLs, or plain text.  
- Remove any existing feature-flag gating so downstream callers can rely on the new pipeline unconditionally.

### Group B (Integration) ‚Äì Branch `feat/whatsapp-audio-hive-integration`
- Update WhatsApp handler to call Group A pipeline for all audio messages.  
- Deliver Hive responses: send text replies via existing text path; use `evolution_api_sender.sendWhatsAppAudio` (bytes‚Üíbase64 + MIME) for byte artifacts; use `sendMedia` (URL + mimetype) when Hive returns a URL.  
- Ensure Omni never enables streaming for this flow and relies on standard routing while removing any obsolete flag checks.

### Group C (Validation) ‚Äì Branch `test/whatsapp-audio-hive-validation`
- Add unit tests for audio extraction, MIME inference, and temp file cleanup.  
- Add integration tests mocking Hive responses (plain text, bytes, and URL variants) validating Evolution send payloads.  
- Document ASR+Answer+TTS pipeline, the always-forward response contract, and operational guidance.

## Execution Notes
- Maintain backward compatibility: text and other media handling must continue as today while audio routes through Hive.  
- Centralize temp file cleanup via context manager to avoid leaks.  
- Capture Hive errors with clear logging to aid future observability work and define graceful fallback if Hive fails.

## Definition of Done
- Audio messages round-trip via Hive successfully in staging, and their responses are forwarded verbatim (text or audio).  
- Hive failures degrade gracefully with clear logs and fallback behavior.  
- Tests green locally and in CI for new coverage.  
- Docs updated so ops understands the always-on bridge and response handling.

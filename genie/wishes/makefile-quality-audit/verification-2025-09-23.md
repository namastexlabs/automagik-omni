# Verification Log — 2025-09-23

## Commands Executed

### make install
- Status: ✅ success
- Notes: uv sync finished without errors; dependency logo banner printed.

### make test
- Status: ⚠️ initial failure → ✅ rerun passed (50s timeout post-summary)
- Details: First run failed because optional `discord.py` extras aren't installed by default. Added a stub-injecting fixture in `tests/test_omni_handlers.py` so the regression suite can execute without forcing optional installs. Rerun completed 338 tests successfully before the harness timeout at ~50s.

### make lint
- Status: ✅ success (after cleanup)
- Details: Removed unused imports in `tests/test_access_control_validation.py` and justified the AccessRule import in `tests/conftest.py` with an inline `# noqa` comment to retain SQLAlchemy registration. Linter now reports a clean slate.

### make test-coverage-summary
- Status: ✅ success
- Details: Pytest coverage run completed in ~52s with 338 passing tests; reported overall 30% coverage and highlighted low-hit Discord/WhatsApp modules.

### make quality
- Status: ❌ failed (mypy errors)
- Details: Ruff portion passed, but mypy emitted 424 errors across 52 files (missing stubs for `requests`, `pytz`, `discord`, plus structural typing issues in Discord/WhatsApp handlers and API routes). Target currently not viable without significant type-checking remediation or configuration tweaks.

### make test-sqlite
- Status: ✅ success
- Details: Forces SQLite backend by unsetting Postgres env vars. Full pytest suite passed in ~49s after the Discord stub fix, confirming the command is redundant with default `make test` but still functional.

### make test-postgres-setup
- Status: ❌ failed (port conflict)
- Details: Docker script attempted to launch container `omni-test-postgres` on port 5432 but the host port is already in use (`Bind for 0.0.0.0:5432 failed`). Need guidance on expected Postgres dev setup or port overrides before recommending this target.

## Follow-Up Questions
- Confirm whether we still want to surface a warning when optional Discord dependencies are absent to guide ops usage.
- Determine remediation path for mypy debt before positioning `make quality` as a reliable guardrail (install typeshed packages, refactor problematic modules, or scope the target).
- Clarify Postgres testing workflow—do we document port prerequisites or add configurability to the Docker helper?

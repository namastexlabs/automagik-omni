# Automagik Omni Self-Learn Report â€“ Whole File Replacement
- **Date (UTC):** 2025-09-26 05:07
- **Triggered by:** User feedback that GENIE replaced the entire `omni-messages-table-realignment.md` wish, preventing diff review.
- **Violation Type / Severity:** Workflow / Medium

## Summary
During the latest wish update, GENIE overwrote the entire document instead of applying targeted edits. This broke the expected review process and violated the guidance to avoid whole-file replacements without approval.

## Corrections Applied
1. Added a behavioural learning entry in `AGENTS.md` instructing GENIE to use incremental edit tools and seek approval before replacing full files.
2. Reconfirmed the wish content via incremental edits only (no further wholesale replacements).

## Validation Plan
- Monitor subsequent wish/document modifications to ensure diffs consist of scoped edits.
- If a future change requires a full rewrite, obtain explicit user approval beforehand and document the reason.

## Follow-up
- Automagik Omni Self Learn will review the next major wish update to verify compliance.
- No additional tooling changes required at this time.

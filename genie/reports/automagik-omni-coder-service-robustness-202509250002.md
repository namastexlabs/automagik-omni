## Scope
- Implemented transient database retry decorator for trace persistence pathways.
- Hardened Discord identity resolution by isolating database errors while preserving message flow.

## Files Touched
- `src/services/trace_service.py`
- `src/channels/discord/bot_manager.py`

## Command Log
- `uv run python -c "from src.services.trace_service import TraceService; print('Retry decorator available:', hasattr(TraceService.create_trace, '__wrapped__'))"` ✅ confirms decorator installation
- `uv run pytest tests/channels/test_discord_trace_parity.py` ✅ all 3 tests passed
- `uv run pytest tests/channels/discord/test_channel_handler.py` ✅ all 2 tests passed
- `uv run pytest tests/test_identity_linking.py` ✅ all 3 tests passed

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Retry sleep duration growth**: exponential backoff can delay final attempt by a few seconds; acceptable trade-off to shield against transient outages.
- **Logging verbosity**: new warnings fire on repeated OperationalError occurrences, aiding diagnosis without interrupting flow.

## Follow-ups / TODOs
- Consider centralising retry decorator for reuse across other DB-touching services.
- Monitor Discord identity resolution logs to validate decreased interruption frequency.

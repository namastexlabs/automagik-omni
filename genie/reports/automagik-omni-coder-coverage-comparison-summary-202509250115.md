# Automagik Omni Coder Death Testament

## Scope
- Fix the failing `Coverage Comparison Summary` step in `.github/workflows/pr-tests.yml` so the github-script action no longer aborts when fetching comments.

## Implementation
- Wrapped the coverage script in a top-level `try/catch`, added PR-context guard, and introduced detailed logging.
- Switched to resolved coverage file paths via `path.join` and expanded parsing to handle multiple `TOTAL` formats.
- Corrected the file-coverage filter so only percentage-bearing entries are surfaced, limiting the list to the top five.
- Normalized comparison output with emoji indicators and resilient fallback branches, while guarding GitHub API interactions with their own `try/catch` blocks.

## Validation
- `DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///data/test.db PYTHONPATH=$PWD uv run python - <<'PY' ...` → recreated SQLite schema without error.
- `DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///data/test.db AUTOMAGIK_OMNI_API_KEY=dummy-key PYTHONPATH=$PWD CI=true uv run pytest ... | tee pytest-coverage.txt` → all 342 tests passed, coverage artefacts generated.
- `node - <<'JS' ...` → executed the updated github-script logic against the generated coverage file using stubbed `github`/`context`; verified graceful comment update path and absence of exceptions.

## Evidence
- Workflow diff: `.github/workflows/pr-tests.yml`.
- GitHub Actions failure reference: run `17993624604`, job `51188655329`, step "Coverage Comparison Summary" (500 on `issues.listComments`).
- Local artefacts cleaned after validation (`pytest-coverage.txt`, `test-results.xml`, `coverage.xml`, `.coverage`, `htmlcov`).

## Risks & Follow-ups
- None observed; next CI run should confirm the script posts/updates the coverage comment without failing. Monitor the next PR Tests workflow for completion and presence of the refreshed comment.
